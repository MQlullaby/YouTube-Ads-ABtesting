# YouTube-Ads-ABtesting

Incrementality testing, also referred to as “Uplift Modeling” or “Incremental Sales Lift”, is a test that measures the impact of a single variable on an individual’s behavior. 
For digital display or video marketing, it is most commonly used to measure the impact of a branded digital ad (Test Group) against a Public Service Announcement (PSA) ad (Control Group). The lift is measured as the percent difference between the two.

An online men’s clothing retailer has developed a testing framework for video advertising on YouTube in order to test the effectiveness of the ads on influencing individuals to purchase from their website. Over the course of 30 days, 600,000 consumers were reached on YouTube. Half of the individuals reached with ads on YouTube were served Public Service Announcement ads, while the other half were served ads for the retailer.

This project uses several statistical methods to see which ads funnel works well.
